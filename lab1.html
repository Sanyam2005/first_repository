        <h2>HTML 5</h2>
        <br>
        <p align = "right">Websockets, another key feature of HTML5, enables real-time communication between the browser and the server. This is crucial for applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications, collaborative editing tools, and online gaming platforms. The WebSocket API simplifies the implementation of bidirectional communication, enhancing the responsiveness of web applications.In conclusion, HTML5 brings a wealth of features that modernize and elevate the capabilities of web development. From multimedia support to advanced APIs and improved form handling, HTML5 empowers developers to create more dynamic, responsive, and feature-rich web applications. As technology continues to evolve, HTML5 remains at the forefront of web development, shaping the way we interact with and experience the online world.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Comic sans-serif;font-size: 20px;">Web fonts have become an integral component of modern web design, playing a crucial role in shaping the visual aesthetics and readability of online content. Unlike the traditional reliance on a limited set of web-safe fonts, web fonts offer a diverse range of typefaces that can be easily integrated into websites, providing designers with more flexibility and creative freedom.One of the primary advantages of web fonts is their ability to enhance the overall design and branding of a website. Designers can choose from a vast library of fonts, encompassing various styles, weights, and characteristics, to align with the brand's identity and convey a specific tone or mood. This diversity allows for a more personalized and visually appealing user experience, contributing to the uniqueness and memorability of a website.</p>

                    Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source[11] web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. It uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.[12] In November 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name "Quantum" to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.[13] Firefox is available for Windows 10 or later versions, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including FreeBSD,[14] OpenBSD,[15] NetBSD,[16] illumos,[17] and Solaris Unix.[18] It is also available for Android and iOS. However, as with all other iOS web browsers, the iOS version uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due to platform requirements. An optimized version is also available on the Amazon Fire TV as one of the two main browsers available with Amazon's Silk Browser.[19]

HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</em>

        <p><b>Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984. The first version of the system software, which had no official name, was partially based on the Lisa OS, which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in 1983. As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable price, it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer, which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed.[1] This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the "System Folder", a set of files that were loaded from disk. The name Macintosh System Software came into use in 1987 with System 5. Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996, starting officially with version 7.6, due in part to its Macintosh clone program.[5] That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997.[6] The last major release of the system was Mac OS 9 in 1999.</b></p>
